# Game of Life - Local Learning

## About

I wonder if each cell in a grid, independently, could learn the rules to [Conway's Game of Life](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Conway%27s_game_of_life)?

I implemented backpropagation neural networks and [echo state networks](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Echo_state_network) for this project.

This was eventually added onto the [Game of Life - Interesting Rules](https://github.com/swirepe/golinteresting) project.
